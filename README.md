# XLM

A fork of the PyTorch implementation of [Cross-lingual Language Model
Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07291), slightly modified to
accomodate using pre-computed negative examples for sentence pair
classification tasks, instead of generating the negative examples
on-the-fly within XLM.
